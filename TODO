- store fingerprint of servers certificate in .aardmail/somewhat; warn if the fingerprint
  does not match; enable checking of the servers certificate using a local ca-file
- add fetchmail frontend
- use the now integrated cram-md5-foo
- add base64
- complete smtpc addr parsing, use plain and cram-md5-auth
- add a sane sendmail (with manpage)
- add some more information to the maildir name
- add auth using client certificates (low prio, need to write a pop3d for testing this first)
  (works with smtpc)
