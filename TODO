- add some more information to the maildir name
- fix windows/obsolete networking code kludge
- do some more testing to the SSL-code (currently it's only confirmed to be working with gmail)
- reconnect if starttls failed and we're allowed to use plaintext (low prio, since that's generally a bad idea)
- add auth using client certificates (low prio, need to write a pop3d for testing this first)
