- use the now integrated cram-md5-foo
- add base64
- complete smtpc addr parsing, use plain and cram-md5-auth
- add a sane sendmail (with manpage)
- add some more information to the maildir name
- do some more testing to the SSL-code (currently it's only confirmed to be working with gmail)
---> release 0.1 is ready
- add auth using client certificates (low prio, need to write a pop3d for testing this first)
